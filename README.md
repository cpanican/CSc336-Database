# CSc336-Database

Homework files and other useful resources that were used in my CCNY CSC336 - Introduction to Database Systems course (Fall 2018). The questions and solutions do not belong to me and were given by Professor Donald Douglas Gordon.

## Notes

- We used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) in this class.
- Assignment 8 was extra credit.
- The code may not be implemented correctly.
- I may not have recieved full marks on code that runs just fine
